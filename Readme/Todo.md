# List of stuff that needs to be done

1. make a list of system environment variables that are recognized by firewall, then update rules.
2. update FirewallParamters with a list of incompatible paramters for reference
3. apply local IP to all rules
4. separate config file for installation directories, or a script which would auto detect installed programs.
5. some rules are missing comments
6. auto detect interfaces
7. CTRL + F and search for "TODO"
8. Implement unique names and groups for rules, -Name and Group paramter vs -Display*
9. make display names and groups modular for easy search, ie. group - subgroup, Company - Program
