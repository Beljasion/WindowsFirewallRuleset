SHORT DESCRIPTION
    Module for logging native PowerShell Write-* commandlets

LONG DESCRIPTION
    Write-Error, Write-Warning and Write-information commandlets are captured and logged into
    a log file while preserving or enhancing the format and display of a stream.

    To make this possible a function which produces an error, warning and info streams must be advanced
    function and must take @Commons splatting which is defined in this module.

    After each command Write-Log is called, which writes log files and prints original stream in the console.

    Behavior of logging can be customized in ProjectSettings.ps1 (WindowsFirewallRuleset project)
