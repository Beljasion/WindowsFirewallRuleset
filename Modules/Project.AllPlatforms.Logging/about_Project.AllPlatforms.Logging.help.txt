SHORT DESCRIPTION
    Module for logging native PowerShell Write-* commandlets

LONG DESCRIPTION
    Write-Error, Write-Warning and Write-information commandlets are captured and logged into
    a log file while preserving the format and display of a stream.

    To make this possible a function which produces an error, warning and info streams must be advanced
    function and must take @Logs splatting which is defined in this module.

    After each command or once in a while Update-Logs is called, which writes generated data into log files.

    Behavior of logging can be customized in ProjectSettings.ps1 (WindowsFirewallRuleset project)

VARIABLES
    @Logs        splatting which defines common parameters where streams are capured
    ErrorStatus     Global variable which holds true if errors were generated
    WarningStatus   Global variable which holds true if warning were generated
    CheckInitLogging    Purpose is to prevent double initialization of constans

    Another-Function @Logs

    Some-Function @Logs | Another-Function @Logs
    Update-Logs
